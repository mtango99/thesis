# Procedure
Catalog all procedures used here in an *ordered* table documenting any code or other research procedure/protocol documents. Provide a brief description of the purpose of each procedure and piece of code.

Catalog the files in [procedure_metadata.csv](procedure_metadata.csv)

See the example table below, and modify the table to suit your research design.

protocol | Model_InfoSheet.pdf | detailed explanations of the models and R scripts |
model | preprocessinglandcover.model3 | model used to preprocess NALCMS data |
model | thesismodel.model3 | model used to do geographic analysis of data and some landscape metrics |
code | Thesis_R2.R | code to calculate the rest of the landscape metrics |
code | rf_example.R | code to do random forests calculation and generalized linear model with variable ranking using AICc |
